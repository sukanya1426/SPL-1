“ Implementation of a  File Transfer Protocol (FTP) System” is a project that will facilitate efficient and reliable file transfer between a client and server over a computer network. . It will be done using socket programming in C/C++ to create the client-server communication framework for data exchange . Additionally,  a user interface will be incorporated to visualize the real-time progress of file transfers, enhancing user experience and providing immediate feedback on successful file transfers. To ensure data security,  encryption and authentication mechanisms  will be implemented. 
 
The project will focus on implementing a basic FTP system . The system will be designed to handle small to medium-sized files . The integration of encryption algorithms and authentication mechanisms will ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data during file transfers ..
